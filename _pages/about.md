Hi, my name is Eunseong (Korean: 은성; Hanja: 恩聖; Korean pronunciation: [[ɯnsʌŋ]](assets\audio\pronounciation.mp3){:target="_blank"}). I'm an economics Ph.D. student currently pursuing my studies at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/).

At present, I am fortunate to be part of the vibrant research unit "Environmental and Climate Economics" at the [ZEW - Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research](https://www.zew.de/en).

Join me as I explore the intricacies of economic theory, research, and the pursuit of knowledge in this dynamic field.
